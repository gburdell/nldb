+ JNI+nldb proved too slow and memory hog on some huge designs worked
  w/ kpfalzer.  We did get JNI + Tcl going (though).
+ After some discussions, decided to switch to all c++.
+ kpfalzer passwd along a verilog netlist parser and dbase in c++.
+ I bolted on a tclsh wrapper and works (see vnl/tcl/README).
+ I took the parser/slf.g and converted to lexer/parser.cxx.
+ So, we have a path to netlist manipulator using c++ and tcl.
+ progress continues...

+ grabbed source from //http://sourceforge.net/projects/nldb
  (thanx kpfalzer), and started adding some jni stuff.
  Plan on using jni to hook to C/C++ to add tcl cli.
