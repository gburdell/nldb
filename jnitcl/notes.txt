==========
a) tcl/C++ side sends Object[] to jni.TclBridge.execute.
b) For debug, TclBridge will print args to execute.
c) The print stream shall be replayable to enavle java side to run w/o tcl/C++ side.
d) That means that every object returned by TclBridge needs to have its Object.toString()
   value recorded in hash, along w/ outgoing object.
e) That way, TclBridge.print emits toString value for its object args.
f) During replay, the hash value for the string key is used; since during replay the tcl/C++ side
   is not actually getting jobject created as return during Command processing.

to make/run:

make debug && make -C tcl8.4.19 debug JVM_ROOT=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.26 && ( setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.26/jre/lib/amd64/server ; gdb -x gdb.ini tcl8.4.19/dist/debug/linux/nl_shell )

===========
Configue netbeans Build|Packaging to Copy dependent libs to dist/lib.
That (relative) path is added to jar manifest.  Thus, set class.path to
dist/nldb.jar, so underlying lib gets pulled indirectly via manifest.
